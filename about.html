<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Steve and I graduated 2 years ago from an university in the Netherlands as a Software Engineer! </p>
    
<p>During my school time I've worked in 3 different tech companies as an intern full stack software engineer ranging from a start up to a middle sized company.  

    Over the past few years I've learned a ton at the companies that I worked on and in my free time I programmed some of my own projects as well.
    
    With the knowledge that I've gained I want to share to amongst other people such as software engineering/computer science students or just simply people 
    that are interested/starting out in tech to help them out, hence the name Tech Life Advice! </p>

<p>Note: I'm NOT an expert in this field, so don't have too high expectations of me, but hey maybe I know some secret shortcuts/handy tech tools that you maybe never knew and that counts too right?
    See this website more of an informal general tech advice website where I post my thoughts, reviews, solutions to all sorts of problems that one may encounter when working in the tech industry. 
    
    Some more concrete examples of content that you can expect: How I built my own website, Review on the Logitech MX Ergo, What tools I use to maximize my productivity and many more related content like this! For any updates I'd suggest to check back here often!
    
    Other than educational content I'll occasionally share my personal struggles, experiences as well so that you'll also get to know me a litle bit better.</p>

<p>Anyway that sums up the reason why I started this website. I'll be trying my best to update this website by creating weekly content. Thanks for reading and enjoy your stay!</p>
